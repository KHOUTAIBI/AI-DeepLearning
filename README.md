# TSIA-TP

This repository contains a series of practical assignments completed for the TSIA (Traitement du Signal pour l'Intelligence Artificielle) course. It includes hands-on exercises in machine learning, optimization, and time series analysis, implemented in Python using Jupyter notebooks.

## Contents

- [`ML/`](./ML): Introductory machine learning exercises
- [`OptimizationForML/`](./OptimizationForML): Optimization techniques applied to ML
- [`Time-Series-1/`](./Time-Series-1): Introduction to time series processing
- [`Time-Series-2/`](./Time-Series-2): Advanced time series modeling and forecasting
